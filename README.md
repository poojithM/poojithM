## 🧠 My Journey into GenAI, Agentic Systems, and Deep Learning

My journey into the world of AI began with a strong curiosity for **Generative AI**, **Deep Learning models**, and **Agentic frameworks** that could automate intelligent behavior. Instead of just learning traditional machine learning, I focused on understanding how large-scale models like GPTs and LLaMAs could be fine-tuned and deployed to solve real-world problems.

Over time, I specialized in designing **multi-agent AI systems** using frameworks like CrewAI and AutoGen, and worked extensively on **fine-tuning LLMs** using efficient techniques like QLoRA. My work involves combining the power of generative models with structured agentic workflows to build autonomous, reliable, and scalable AI applications.

Today, my projects span building **instruction-tuned chatbots**, **multimodal document interpreters**, and **GenAI-powered feedback analyzers**, all backed by a deep understanding of modern AI architectures, cloud deployments, and vector-based retrieval systems.
