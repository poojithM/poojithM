##  My Journey into Generative AI

My journey into the world of AI began with a strong curiosity for **Deep Learning models**, **Generative AI** and **Agentic frameworks** that could automate intelligent behavior. Instead of just learning traditional machine learning, I focused on understanding how large-scale models like GPTs and LLaMAs could be fine-tuned and deployed to solve real-world problems.

Over time, I specialized in designing **multi-agent AI systems** using frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, langgraph and smol agent and worked extensively on **fine-tuning LLMs** using efficient techniques like Lora, Qlora. My work involves combining the power of generative models with structured agentic workflows to build autonomous, reliable, and scalable AI applications.

Today, my projects span building **instruction-tuned chatbots**, **multilingual document interpreters**, and **Agentic AI powered feedback analyzers**, all backed by a deep understanding of modern AI architectures, cloud deployments, and vector-based retrieval systems.

##  Projects

- **Customer Service Audio Analyzer**:  
  Advanced AI transforms customer review audio into actionable insights for restaurants and hotels. Using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper for transcription and a CrewAI multi-agent framework to summarize, analyze sentiment, extract keywords, and generate reports, it optimizes operations and service quality.

- **Instruction-Based Fine-Tuning**:  
  Fine-tuned the Phi-3 Mini model on MTU Data Science content using QLoRA via Unsloth. Used CrewAI agents to scrape the website and generate Q&A pairs for instruction tuning.

- **AudioScribe AI**:  
  This Streamlit app extracts YouTube video transcripts using OpenAI's Whisper, stores embeddings in a Chroma vector database, and leverages GPT-4o to answer user queries based on the video content.

- **Multilingual PDF Interpreter**:  
  This project utilizes advanced AI and the CrewAI framework with specialized agents to enhance PDF document accessibility by processing, summarizing, and translating content into multiple languages.
